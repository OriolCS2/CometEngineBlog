[{"content":"Comet Engine is currently using C# for the scripting system. C# is a really powerful programming language but I have found trouble when trying to export for Web and Android. That is why some weeks ago I started looking for a new scripting language more cross-platform friendly.\nAfter some research I gave a try to this three languages:\nLua: It is one of the most known scripting languages and it is really easy to embed to a C++ application using Sol3. After making a try to integrate this language I decided to look for another because Lua is not an object oriented language and I would like to find one that it is. This is how lua looks like: Chaiscript: It is a javascript-like scripting language created to be embeded to C++ applications. I did also some testing using it and I was feeling really comfortable working with it, but after reading more about it I felt that it was not prepared to be exported to Web or Android even if some post said that it was possible. As the main purpose is to change to a cross-platform language I had to give up implementing this one. Chaiscript looks like this: AngelScript: It is a scripting language really similar to C# and also it could be compared to C++ as well. It is mainly used to be integrated to C/C++ applications. It is a object oriented language and it is compiled in byte code, so this makes this language to be type safety. Also the C++ library used to embed this language works almost the same way I used with C# with mono. This is the most important point because this will allow me to keep everything from my current scripting system and I just have to adapt some new things. A few days ago I started adapting all the Comet Engine C# classes to Angelscript and even if the syntaxis is quite the same I think it will take me about 6 months to adapt the 300 C# script files to AngelScript. So I expect that just before the ending of 2025 I will be able to release a CometEngine_v2.0_Beta version.\nHere it is a comparasion between the same script in C# and in AngelScript:\nOnce I will have all the AngelScript scripting integrated, I will take a look to export to Web and Android again. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if AngelScript has been a good choice.\n","date":"2025-05-27T21:48:32Z","image":"https://OriolCS2.github.io/CometEngineBlog/p/scripting-system-rework/cover_hu_29835fb8ca3589ce.png","permalink":"https://OriolCS2.github.io/CometEngineBlog/p/scripting-system-rework/","title":"Scripting System Rework"},{"content":"Welcome everyone to my blog about Comet Engine. In this blog I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about the development and current features of my custom game engine, Comet Engine.\nFirst of all, what is Comet Engine? It is a custom game engine made from scratch with C++, SDL3 and OpenGL. It\u0026rsquo;s been 4 years since I started developing it and now it looks like this: At this point the main features are:\n2D Rendering Sprite atlas subsystem Physics 2D Lighting 2D and 3D Audio Custom Shaders Bunch of in editor customizations Exporting for Windows and Linux It is also possible to create game scripts using the C# system integrated in Comet, but now I\u0026rsquo;m working on a new system because it\u0026rsquo;s been quite difficult to export the C# system to web or android. So expect a new Comet Engine major version (2.0) breaking the compatibility with C# is comming this year! This topic will have a custom post soon.\nI attach a presentation trailer that I made 3 years ago in order to start understanding what is Comet and how it works! Feel free to share comments or questions ;)\n","date":"2025-05-13T18:49:32Z","image":"https://OriolCS2.github.io/CometEngineBlog/p/comet-engine/cover_hu_c660b054c4d9c198.png","permalink":"https://OriolCS2.github.io/CometEngineBlog/p/comet-engine/","title":"Comet Engine"}]
